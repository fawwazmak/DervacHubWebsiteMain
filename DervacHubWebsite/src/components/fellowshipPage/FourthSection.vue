            Learners who cannot afford the training costs at once can opt for the DFIB (Dervac Financial Investment Bond). This is a (Work-Earn-Pay) action plan. Here, Dervac through its financier partners will agree to sponsor learners throughout the training under which the student agrees to pay XY% of your post-training income to spread repayment over a duration up to 12 months as agreed by the candidate. An initial commitment of 5% payment is mandatory for management approval. Learner or attend the training FREE but with a post training commitment of 12 months bond.
